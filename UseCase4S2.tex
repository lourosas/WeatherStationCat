\textbf{Use Case U4:  Choose the Units to view the Current Weather
Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Choose Units for Barometric Pressure Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }U1: \textit{The User shall have the
ability to view the Latest Measured Data}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Who want to view the Barometric Pressure Data in
English, Metric, or millibars
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Application is started.  The Weather
Station is online.  The Barometer is online and measuring.  The
The Current Barometric Pressure Data is currently being viewed
\textit{(See Use Case 1:  View the Latest Measured Weather Data)}.\\
\textbf{Success Gurantees:  }The System displays the Barometric
Pressure in the User Requested Units (English, Metric, millibars).
\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
 1.  Choose the Units (inches, millimeters, millibars) to view
 the Barometric Pressure & \\\hline
& 2.  Displays the Requested Units (inches, millimeters, millibars)
for the Current Barometric Pressure Measurement\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions:  }\\
*a.  If the data is not accurate due to Sensors being offline, then
the System will alert the the User of the issue.\\
2a.  If the view of the System is already displaying the requestd
Units, then the System will take no action.\\
\textbf{Frequecy Of Occurence: } Almost constant.\\\\
