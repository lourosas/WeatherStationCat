\textbf{Use Case U1:  View the Latest Measured Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }View Heat Index Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }U2: \textit{The User shall have the
ability to select different types of Views in viewing the Measured
Weather Data}\\ U4:  \textit{The User shall have the ability to
choose the Units to view the Current Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Who wants to view the Heat Index Data
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Thermometer is online and measuring.\\
The Hygrometer is online and Measuring.\\
\textbf{Success Gurantees:  }The User views the current Heat Index
Data.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request to view the Heat Index Data & \\\hline
& 2.  Displays the Heat Index Data in the currently requested
units\\\hline
& 3.  Displays the Time (Day, Date, Time, Time Zone) of the
Heat Index Calculation\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions:  }\\
1a.  If the view of the System is already displaying the Heat Index
data, then the System will take no action.\\
1b.  If the System is not running, then User will start the System
first to view the Heat Index Data.\\
2a,3a.  If the Temperatur Sensor is not working, then the System
alerts the User of the Issue.\\
2b,3b.  If the Hygrometer is not working, then the System alerts the
User of the Issue.\\
\textbf{Frequecy Of Occurence: } Depends upon the Measurement
Frequency set in the System.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues: }
\begin{itemize}
\item What is displayed when the Temperature is below $70^\circ$F?
The Heat Index calculation is not accurate below
$70\circ$F.
\end{itemize}
