\textbf{Use Case U1:  View the Latest Measured Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }View Temperature Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }U2: \textit{The User shall have the
ability to select different types of Views in viewing the Measured
Weather Data}\\ U4:  \textit{The User shall have the ability to
choose the Units to view the Current Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Who wants to view the Temperature Data
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Thermometer is online and measuring.\\
\textbf{Success Gurantees:  }The User views the current Temperature
Data.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request to view the Temperature Data & \\\hline
& 2.  Displays the Temperature Data in the currently requested
units\\\hline
& 3.  Displays the Time (Day, Date, Time, Time Zone) of the
Temperature Measurement\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions:  }\\
1a.  If the view of the System is already displaying the Temperatue
data, then the System will take no action.\\
1b.  If the System is not running, then User will start the System
first to view the Temperature Data.\\
2a,3a.  If the Temperatur Sensor is not working, the then System
alerts the User of the Issue.\\\
\textbf{Frequecy Of Occurence: } Depends upon the Measurement
Frequency set in the System.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues: }
\begin{itemize}
\item What if the Thermo Sensor is broken?  Does the System continue
to collect/measure the other Weather Data?
\end{itemize}
