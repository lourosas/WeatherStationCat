\textbf{Use Case U4:  Chose the Units to view the Current Weather
Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }Chose Units for Temperature, Dewpoint, Heat
Index Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }U1: \textit{The User shall have the
ability to view the Latest Measured Data}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Who want to view the Temperature, Heat Index, Dew Point
in Degrees Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The Application is started. The Weather
Station is online. The Thermometer is online and measuring.
The Hygrometer is online and measuring. The Temperature, Dew Point
or Heat Index Data is currently being viewed
\textit{(See Use Case 1:  View the Latest Measured Weather Data)}.\\
\textbf{Success Gurantees:  }The System displays the Temperature,
Heat Index, Dew Point in the User Requested Units (Degrees
Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin).
\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
 1.  Chose the Units (Degrees Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin) to view
 the Temperature, Heat Index, Dew Point Data& \\\hline
& 2.  Displays the Current Units (Degrees Fahrenheit, Celsius,
Kelvin) for the Current Measurement (Temperature, Heat Index,
Dewpoint)\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions:  }\\
*a.  If the data is not accurate due to Sensors being offline, then
the System will alert the the User of the issue.\\
2a.  If the view of the System is already displaying the requestd
Units, then the System will take no action.\\
\textbf{Frequecy Of Occurence: } Almost constant.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues: } None
