\textbf{Use Case U1:  View the Latest Measured Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }View Barometric Pressure Data\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }U2: \textit{The User shall have the
ability to select different types of Views in viewing the Measured
Weather Data}\\ U4:  \textit{The User shall have the ability to
choose the Units to view the Current Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Who wants to view the Barometric Pressure Data
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The  Barometer is online and measuring.\\
\textbf{Success Gurantees:  }The User views the current Barometric
Pressure Data.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request to view the Barometric Pressure Data & \\\hline
& 2.  Displays the Barometric Pressure Data in the currently
requested units\\\hline
& 3.  Displays the Time (Day, Date, Time, Time Zone) of the
Barometric Pressure Measurement\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions:  }\\
1a.  If the view of the System is already displaying the Barometric
Pressure data, then the System will take no action.\\
1b.  If the System is not running, then User will start the System
first to view the Baroemetric Pressure Data.\\
2a,3a.  If the Barometer is not working, the then System
alerts the User of the Issue.\\\
\textbf{Frequecy Of Occurence: } Depends upon the Measurement
Frequency set in the System.\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues: }
\begin{itemize}
\item What if the Barometer is broken?  Does the System continue
to collect/measure the other Weather Data?
\end{itemize}
