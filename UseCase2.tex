\textbf{Use Case 2:  Archive Current Weather Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor: }User\\
\textbf{Secondary Actor:  }Database (to be developed)\\
\textbf{Scenerio:  }None\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  }\textit{Use Case 1:  The User shall have
the ability to Request The Weather Station to measure the weather
data}\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  Wants to archive the current measured weather data
\item Database:  (Wants to) Save off the current measured weather
data requested by the User
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The System is online and is periodically
measuring the weather instruments. The System is sending the most
recent data to all registered subscribers. \textbf{(To Be Developed)}
the SQL database is up, the System is registered to the data base.\\
\textbf{Success Guarantees:  }The System arhives the weather data and
(to be developed) sends the data to and SQL database.\\\\

\textbf{Main Success Scenerio:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Save all current weather data & \\\hline
& 2.  Prompts the User to select where to save the weather
data with a file name\\\hline
3.  Enters the file name and location to archive the weather
data & \\\hline
& 4.  Creates the file at the specified location\\\hline
& 5.  Collects all the required data for saving.\\\hline
& 6.  Saves the data in the file\\\hline
& 7.  Closes the file of the saved weather data\\\hline
& 8.  Prompts the user the data was saved off\\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions:  }\\
4a.  If the files exists, then the System appends the data to the
User selected file.\\
6a.  If there is a saving error (cannot save the data, the saving
process failed), then the System indicates to the user of the
error.\\\\
\textbf{Frequency of Occurence:  }Almost continuous\\\\
\textbf{Open Issues:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item  Eventually, a SQL database (secondary actor) is to connect up
to the System for data achiving in addition to the User selected
file.
\end{itemize}
