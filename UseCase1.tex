\textbf{Use Case 1:  Request Measured Data}\\
\textbf{Scope:  }Weather Station\\
\textbf{Level:  }User Goal\\
\textbf{Primary Actor:  }User\\
\textbf{Scenario:  }None\\
\textbf{Related Use Cases:  } None\\
\textbf{Stakeholders \& Interests:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item User:  wants the current weather data 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Preconditions:  }The System is online and is periodically
measuring the weather instruments.\\
\textbf{Success Gurantees:  }The System returns the entire Weather
Data suite to the User.\\\\
\textbf{Main Success Scenario:  }\\
\begin{tabular}{|p{6cm}|p{6cm}|}\hline
\textbf{User} & \textbf{System}\\\hline
1.  Request all the current Weather Data & \\\hline
& 2. Measures the Themometer, converts the Temperature data into
Fahrenheit and Kelvin and returns the data in all three units\\\hline
& 3.  Measures the Hygrometer and reuturns the data\\\hline
& 4.  Measures the Barometer, converts the Pressure data into
miilimeters of Mercury, and inches of Mercury and returns the data in
all three units\\\hline
& 5.  Calculates the Dewpoint, converts the data into Fahrenheit and
Kelvin and returns the Dewpoint Data in all three units.\\\hline
& 6.  Calculates the Heatindex, converts the data into Fahrenheit and
Kelvin and returns the Heatindex data in all three units.\\\hline
7.  Outside of Humidity, the User choses the units to view the data
    returned in 2-6 & \\\hline
\end{tabular}\\\\
\textbf{Extensions:  }\\
2a,3a,4a.  If any or all of the Sensors are broken, then the System
alerts the User of the Issue.\\\\
\textbf{Frequecy Of Occurence: } Almost continuous\\\\
\textbf{Special Requirements:  }
\begin{itemize}
\item The System periodically monitors the sensors, measuring the
for the measured data
\item On every occurence of the System monitoring the sensors, the
System
uses the measured data and caluculates Weather Data that is calculated
\item On every occurence of the System monitoring the sensors, the
System broadcasts the Weather Data for observers
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Open Issues: }
\begin{itemize}
\item What if one or many of the Sensors are broken?  Does the System
continue to measure/collect other measured Weather Data?
\end{itemize}
